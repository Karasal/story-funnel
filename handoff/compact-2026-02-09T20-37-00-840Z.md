2. **Hero** — Full viewport, "Your Life Is A Movie. Let's Shoot It.", $500 price, scarcity ("3 spots/month")
3. **Video Showcase** — Two YouTube embeds (locked down: no YT branding, no related vids, no fullscreen escape)
   - Video 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLwo8clXyZM
   - Video 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxeU_tq7jH8
4. **Film Strip** — Infinite scrolling frames ("Your Origin", "Your Struggle", etc.)
5. **The Problem** — PAS copy: "Your Story Is Being Told Without You"
6. **The Monomyth** — Hero's Journey explanation + animated SVG circle diagram + "We Map Your Story To This Arc"

## Research Completed (5 parallel agents)
1. RED KOMODO-X camera website design patterns
2. Neobrutalism web design (dark mode specific)
3. High-converting sales funnels for creative services
4. Best filmmaker/documentary portfolio sites
5. CSS/animation techniques for cinematic web

## Key Conversion Features Applied
- Sticky mobile CTA (appears/hides smartly)
- Honest scarcity: "ONLY 3 SPOTS PER MONTH"
- Value stack: "$2,000+ value — yours for $500"
- Action-specific CTA: "Book My Free Discovery Call"
- Risk reversal: "No commitment" text
- Named methodology: "The Reel Story Method™"
- Pre-qualifying section: "This Is For You If"

## Form Backend
- Currently client-side only (shows success message with "REC" animation)
- Code comments explain how to connect: Formspree, Zapier, EmailJS, or Supabase
- Needs Formspree form ID or similar endpoint

## Tech
- Single HTML file, ~900 lines
- Zero dependencies (except Google Fonts CDN)
- YouTube embeds use youtube-nocookie.com with locked params
- Mobile responsive, all breakpoints covered
- IntersectionObserver for scroll reveals + sticky CTA logic
- Animated SVG Hero's Journey diagram with draw-on-scroll
- Animated film grain (shifting position), scanlines overlay
